# Welcome to my Resume

Currently studying at EPITECH in 5th year, I love to challenge myself, learning new programming languages or train for sports races. Moreover It was very important for me to have side-jobs during my studies, therefore french freelance program was a real opportunity. Hard work, professionalism, organisation, being efficient, are things I have learn from all this experiences.

I love to discus  and correct new students exercise on  exercism.io. It feel great to help them going forward, and polishing my knowledge to be more and more relevant.
