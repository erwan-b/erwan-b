# Welcome to my Resume

I love to challenge myself, learning new programming languages or train for sports races. Moreover, It was very important for me to have side-jobs during my studies, therefore french freelance program was a real opportunity. Hard work, professionalism, organisation, being efficient, are things I have learned from all these experiences. 

I love to discuss and correct new students exercise on exercism.io. It feels great to help them to go forward, and polishing my knowledge to be more and more relevant.
